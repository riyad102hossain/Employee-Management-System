 # Employee Management System

## About the Project

The **Employee Management System** is a web application designed to efficiently manage employee records. The system enables users to add, edit, search, and delete employee records, while ensuring performance and user experience through optimized image handling, sorting, and pagination features.

### Key Features:

- **Add Employee**: Users can add new employees, including their photo, first name, last name, email, mobile, and date of birth.
- **Edit and Delete Actions**: The "Edit" button navigates to the edit page, allowing users to update existing employee records. The "Delete" button triggers a confirmation popup with "Yes" and "No" options to confirm or cancel the deletion.
- **Sortable Columns**: Users can sort employee data by name, email, mobile, and date of birth.
- **Pagination**: Employee data is fetched from the database in pages, ensuring that only a limited number of records are retrieved at a time, improving performance even with large datasets.
- **Partial Search**: The system supports partial search queries for name, email, mobile, and date of birth fields, enabling quick and efficient filtering of records.

### Technologies Used:

- **ASP.NET Core**: For building the web application.
- **C#**: The primary programming language used for the backend logic.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive and user-friendly UI design.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For database interactions and object-relational mapping (ORM).
- **Microsoft SQL Server**: For managing the application's relational database.
- **JavaScript & jQuery**: For interactive elements like sorting, pagination, and date pickers.
